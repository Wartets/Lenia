      "theory.intro-text1": "Lenia is a continuous generalization of cellular automata discovered by Bert Wang-Chak Chan in 2018. Unlike discrete systems like Conway's Game of Life, Lenia operates in continuous space, time, and state, producing remarkably life-like emergent behaviors. The name \"Lenia\" derives from the Latin word lenis, meaning \"smooth\" or \"gentle\", a fitting description for the fluid, organic patterns that emerge from its rules.",
      "theory.intro-text2": "What makes Lenia remarkable is its capacity for open-ended evolution. By adjusting just a handful of parameters, researchers have discovered thousands of distinct \"species\", stable, self-organizing patterns that move, pulse, and interact in ways reminiscent of microscopic organisms. Some glide smoothly across the grid, others spin or oscillate, and some even split or merge. This richness emerges from the interplay of local interactions governed by mathematical functions.",

His goal was to create a mathematical model that could reproduce itself and perform universal computation, proving that machines could theoretically build copies of themselves. This laid the groundwork for all future research in artificial life and computational biology.",

With just two states (alive/dead) and four rules based on neighbor counts, Conway's automaton could generate gliders, oscillators, and even universal computers. This captured public imagination and inspired generations of researchers to explore emergent complexity.",

By allowing continuous states (values between 0 and 1) while keeping discrete time steps, SmoothLife created smoother, more organic-looking patterns than the Game of Life.

      "theory.discrete-continuous-title": "From Discrete to Continuous",
      "theory.discrete-continuous-intro": "Understanding Lenia requires grasping three fundamental transitions from classical cellular automata. Each transition introduces new mathematical richness and dramatically expands the space of possible behaviors.",
      "theory.continuous-states-title": "Continuous States",
      "theory.continuous-states-desc": "Instead of binary alive/dead states, each cell holds a continuous value in the range [0, 1]. This allows for smooth gradients and more organic-looking patterns.",
      "theory.continuous-states-why": "Why it matters: Continuous states enable gradual transitions rather than abrupt on/off switching. A cell can be \"partially alive\", think of it as cell density or concentration rather than presence/absence. This creates smooth boundaries between patterns and their surroundings, producing the organic, fluid appearance characteristic of Lenia creatures.",
      "theory.continuous-states-intuition": "Physical intuition: Imagine each cell as a container holding some amount of a substance (between empty=0 and full=1). The simulation describes how this substance flows and transforms based on local conditions.",
      "theory.continuous-neighborhoods-title": "Continuous Neighborhoods",
      "theory.continuous-neighborhoods-desc": "The neighborhood is defined by a kernel function K(r) that smoothly weights contributions from nearby cells based on distance, rather than using a fixed Moore or von Neumann neighborhood.",
      "theory.continuous-neighborhoods-why": "Why it matters: Instead of counting neighbors in a fixed square or cross pattern, the kernel defines a smooth influence profile. Cells at distance r contribute proportionally to K(r). The Gaussian shell kernel creates a ring of maximum influence at distance βR, with the ring's thickness controlled by α.",
      "theory.continuous-neighborhoods-intuition": "Physical intuition: Think of dropping a pebble in water, the ripples have maximum amplitude at a certain distance from the center, then decay. The kernel describes this influence pattern mathematically.",

      "theory.continuous-time-desc": "Updates occur with a configurable time step Δt, allowing for smooth temporal evolution rather than discrete jumps.",
      "theory.continuous-time-why": "Why it matters: Discrete automata update all cells simultaneously in a single \"tick.\" Continuous time means we can take arbitrarily small steps, making the evolution smoother and more predictable. Smaller Δt values give finer temporal resolution but slower real-time evolution.",
      "theory.continuous-time-intuition": "Mathematical connection: As Δt → 0, the discrete update approaches a differential equation: ∂A/∂t = G(K * A). Lenia is thus a discretization of a PDE (partial differential equation).",
